            "content": "What are functions? . A function assigns an element of one set to another set. For example, f(x) = 2x + 1 assigns elements of the set of real numbers to another set of real numbers. To denote functions, we use this notation: . f: A -&gt; B . which means that A is the domain of f, and f is assigning elements to B, the codomain. f(a) = b means that f assigns b, an element of B, to argument a, which is an element of A. . What is the domain and codomain? The domain is the set of all arguments that are able to be passed into the function. The codomain are all possible outcomes of the function. This contrasts with the range, which are all possible values that a function can return for each argument. For example, consider the function below. . . The left oval represents the domain, and the right represents the codomain. The domain of the function is {1, 2, 3} and the codomain is {5, 6, 7, 8}. The range on the other hand, is {5, 6, 8} because 7 is never returned for any of the arguments inputted into f. Therefore, the range will always be a subset of the codomain. . A function doesn&#39;t need to be defined for every element in the domain. For example, if our function was f(x) = ln(x) and our domain was all real numbers, it wouldn&#39;t return anything for any argument less than 0. Arguments less than 0 are still part of the domain, but they are undefined. . As shown by the function diagram, doesn&#39;t need to return every element in the codomain either. Although 7 is part of the codomain B, it is not returned for any argument. . Function Properties . Partial Function - A function is a partial function if there are domain elements that are undefined. Examples include f(x) = ln(x), f(x) = (1/x). . Total Function - A function with all elements in the domain defined is called a total function. Examples include: f(x) = x . Surjective - A function where the codomain = range. In other words, for every argument a in the domain, f returns an argument b, where b is in the codomain. . Injective - Also known as one to one. This means that every input maps to a different output. To test this, use the Vertical Line Test and the Horizontal Line Test with the graph of a function. . Bijective - These are functions that are both surjective and injective. . Multiple Inputs . If there are multiple inputs, the domain is a cartesian product. For example, consider the function f(x,y) = x^y. The Domain is {True, False}^2 because you could input the following: {(True, True), (True, False), (False, True), (False, False)}. . What are Relations? . Relations can be thought of in two ways, a special type of function or a generalizaion of a function. . Relations as a Type of Function . If we think of relations as a type of function, then relations are a function whose codomain is {True, False}. This means that relations are also known as predicates. However, relations can always be computed, while predicates can be defined abstractly. . Relations have several properties: . Are nearly always total if we treat undefined as false | Are nearly aways surjective | Are nearly not always injective | . Relations as a Generalization of a Function . We can also treat relations as a generalization of a function. This means that relations also assign elements of the domain to the codomain, except that relations can have multiple values in the codomain for one value in the domain. . How these definitions relate to each other . Both definitions of a relation actually say the same thing. If we have a set S . S = {(0,0), (4,2), (4, -2) ...} . then we can define the relation in two ways: . R(x, y): (x, y) E S (evaluates to true or false) | R(x, y): y^2 = x | . Binary Relations . A binary relation is a special type of relation that relates two values, and are commonly used in programming. For example, binary relations include: . &lt;, &lt;=, ==, &gt;, &gt;=, != . To illustrate this, consider the code below: . x = 2 y = 3 x &lt; y . True . As shown below, &lt; is a binary relation because it evaluates to true or false. . Properties of Binary Relations . Symmetric - If x is related to y, then y is related to x. Example: == . x = 4 y = 4 if(x == y): print(&quot;x == y is true&quot;) if(y == x): print(&quot;y == x is true&quot;) . x == y is true y == x is true . Transitive If x is related to y, and y is related to z, then x must be related to z. Example: &lt; . x = -3 y = -2 z = -1 if(x &lt; y): print(&quot;x &lt; y is true&quot;) if(y &lt; z): print(&quot;y &lt; z is true&quot;) if(x &lt; z): print(&quot;x &lt; z is true&quot;) . x &lt; y is true y &lt; z is true x &lt; z is true . Reflexive - X is always related to itself. Example: == . print(x == x) . True . Irreflexive - For every value x, x is always not related to itself. Example: &gt; . print(y &gt; y) . False . Antisymmetric - If x is related to y, then y is not related to x. Example: &lt;= . x = 3 y = 4 if(x &lt;= y): print(&quot;x &lt;= y is true&quot;) if(y &lt;= x): print(&quot;y &lt;= x is true&quot;) . x &lt;= y is true . Asymmetric - Means both irreflexive, and antisymmetric. . Equivalence Relation - Means the binary relation is symmetric, transitive, and reflexive. . Total Order - This means that the binary relation is asymmetric, transitive, and irreflexive. . Partial Order - Means that the binary relation is antisymmetric, transitive, and reflexive. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
